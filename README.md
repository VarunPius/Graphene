# Cryptography
Cryptography is the study of taking in data and scrambling it so that it ensures security and privacy of the users. In simple words, it's the science of creating secrets.

The main topics in Basics of Cryptography are:
- Hashing
- Salting
- Encoding
- Encryption
    - Symmetrical
    - Asymmetrical

# Chapters
- **Chapter 1**: [Symmetric Encryption](1_BasicImplementation/symmetric/3_SymmetricEncryption.md)
    Includes the following topics:
    - [Hashing](1_BasicImplementation/symmetric/1_Hashing.md)
    - Salting (refer Hashing for notes)
    - [Encoding](1_BasicImplementation/symmetric/2_Encoding.md)
    - Symmetrical Encryption
- **Chapter 2**: [Asymmetric Encryption](1_BasicImplementation/asymmetric/)
